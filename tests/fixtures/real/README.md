# Real-world test fixtures (optional, committed)

Drop real files here — the e2e suite picks them up automatically and skips
the corresponding tests when a file is absent. Synthetic fixtures (generated
into `../generated/` by `pnpm fixtures`) cover the logic; real files catch
decoder quirks synthetic ones can't (camera EXIF + ICC profiles, odd encoders,
real Ghostscript-hostile PDFs).

Received (2026-07-11 — tests DISCOVER files by extension via `realFile()` in
e2e/fixtures.ts, so exact names don't matter):

| file-example_PDF_1MB-protected-unlocked-protected.pdf | PT-17 positive unlock — **password: 123** (throwaway, deliberately public). Probed: OWNER-ONLY encryption (empty user password) — opens freely, so it can NOT drive E-05/E-07 |
| IMG_0883.HEIC (24.5 MP, Display P3, real iPhone)      | RF-15 (replaces sample1.heic as the sorted `realFile` pick) + KM-08 keep-metadata                                                                                             |
| IMG_0884.HEIC (48.8 MP portrait via irot, Display P3) | RF-16 (max-dimension cap on a 48 MP still; sort never picks it, targeted explicitly)                                                                                          |
| IMG_0885.MOV (4K HEVC, BT.2020 + **HLG = HDR**, APAC) | V-13 — either-or: branded Chrome converts with the HDR warning; the bundled test Chromium has no HEVC decoder, so the guiding refusal is asserted instead                     |

Still wanted:

| `user-locked.pdf`               | E-05/E-07 need a USER-password-locked PDF (refuses to open). Make one: app → Protect (any password) → download → rename to `user-locked.pdf` |
| iPhone `.jpg` **with EXIF+GPS** | X-10 positive GPS-strip branch (the exif tab is JPEG/PNG/WebP only — HEIC doesn't count)                                                     |

Keep files reasonably small (a few MB). Anything else dropped here is ignored
unless a test picks it up by extension.
