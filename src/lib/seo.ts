		faq: [
			{
				q: 'Which output format should I pick?',
				a: 'Usually none — the default Auto mode tries the best formats for every image and keeps the smallest file that still looks right. Pick a specific format only when the destination demands one, like JPG for an upload form.'

			{
				q: 'Is the compression lossless or lossy?',
				a: 'Your choice. The quality slider trades invisible detail for size — around 80 the difference is imperceptible for photos. PNG at quality 100 stays fully lossless, and the built-in before/after compare lets you judge every result.'
